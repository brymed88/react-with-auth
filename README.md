<h1>React-With-Auth Template</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The need for this template has arisen from the numerous React projects I am currently working on. Rather than re-invent the wheel during each new project, this repo aims to provide a basic React Starter Site. 
</p>

<p>
This repo will be a mono-repo and contain files for both the client and server (NodeJS). It will utilize common packages, api endpoints and components.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Authentication using JSON Web Token</li>
<li>Default site pages (Home, About, Contact, Login)</li>
<li>Portable Code/Components</li>
<li>Basic SCSS/CSS including <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a></li>
<li>Component Testing with Jest</li>
</p>

<h2>In Development!</h2>
